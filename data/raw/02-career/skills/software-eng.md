# Expertise · Software Engineering

### Origin Story
- Grade‑6 “aha” moment: mesmerized by hacker scenes in movies, sparking a deep curiosity for computers.
- Joined the specialized Informatics track from middle school and continued in the gifted Informatics class at High School for the Gifted (Năng Khiếu), Ho Chi Minh City.

### Education Milestones
- **B.Sc. in Computer Science** — Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City.
- Research internship at **Polytechnique Montréal** — first journey abroad, opening a global perspective.
- **M.Sc. in Interactive Arts & Technology** — Simon Fraser University, School of Interactive Arts & Design (SIAT), Canada. Funded via TA/RA positions that combined research and teaching.

### Professional Journey
1. **Microsoft (2019 – 2024)** — Data & Analytics Platforms  
   - Built large‑scale data pipelines aggregating telemetry and sales metrics.  
   - Delivered Power BI dashboards for CVP‑level decision‑making.  
   - Saved roughly \$200 k/year through Spark‑based cost governance.  

2. **Meta (2024 – Present)** — Ads Ranking Data Service (ARDS)  
   - Maintain the high‑QPS key‑value store behind Meta **AdRanker**.  
   - Led observability, embedding‑freshness, unified‑metrics, and memory‑profiling initiatives.  
   - Saved 430 k CPU‑hours/month via adaptive batching; boosted feature consistency toward 99.9 %.  

### Technical Stack
- **Languages**: C++17, Python, C#, SQL, KQL  
- **Distributed Systems**: Thrift, gRPC, Service Router, Sharding  
- **Data Platforms**: Azure Data Factory, Databricks, Spark, Presto, Scuba, RocksDB  
- **Visualization & Insight**: Power BI, Tableau  
- **DevOps & Tooling**: Git, Buck, GitHub Actions, Docker, CI/CD pipelines  

### Engineering Philosophies & Strengths
- **Engineering Excellence** — rigorous code quality, observability, and performance tuning.  
- **Mentorship** — enjoys coaching engineers through code reviews and workshops.  
- **Bias for Action** — ships with 80 % confidence, iterates quickly.  
- **Storytelling with Data** — transforms raw telemetry into actionable insights.
