# Data Engineering Skills

_Detailed record of Ted Nguyen’s ability to design and operate large‑scale data systems._

## Summary

Ted has end‑to‑end experience designing, building, and maintaining large‑scale data products, from his time at Microsoft through his current role.

## Key Experience at Microsoft (2019‑2024)

- **Role**: Software Engineer in the Metrics Feature Crew (FC) of a larger organization.  
- **Scope**: End‑to‑end ownership — system design → implementation → product development → testing → monitoring → reliability.  
- **Representative Deliverables**: KPI dashboards, analytics reports, and tools that guided business development.

## Technology Evolution

| Period           | Primary Stack                                       | Strengths                                          | Challenges                                         |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Cosmos DB era    | Cosmos DB                                           | High reliability, strict data hygiene              | Legacy technology, limited flexibility             |
| Azure era        | Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse (Spark)           | Easier orchestration and data manipulation         | Sustaining reliability, auto‑detecting anomalies    |
| OSS era          | Presto, Titan UI                                    | Blazing‑fast queries, multi‑category support, modern UI | Cost optimization, expanding coverage              |

## Lessons & Mindset

1. **Zero tolerance for bad data** — stringent data‑quality gates at Microsoft built a rock‑solid habit.  
2. **Reliability first** — regardless of stack, proactively detect and self‑qualify data anomalies.  
3. **Leverage OSS** — Presto + Titan UI prove that open source can outclass proprietary solutions in both speed and user experience.

## Core Skills

- Data modeling & schema design  
- ETL/ELT pipeline orchestration  
- Spark‑based distributed processing  
- Interactive SQL engines (Presto/Trino)  
- Dashboarding & BI (Power BI, internal Titan)  
- Monitoring & alerting (custom data‑quality rules)

## Relevance to Current Goals

These experiences enable Ted to rapidly assess and optimize feature stores at Meta and to accelerate the upcoming project.
