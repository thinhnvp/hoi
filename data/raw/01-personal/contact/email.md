# Overview

Ted maintains separate email addresses to compartmentalize professional, personal, and public communications while limiting cross‑tracking.

| Purpose | Address | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Public / Personal Brand** | contact@tedditory.co | Primary point of contact for the Tedditory blog, networking, and general inquiries. |
| **Current Work** | tedn@meta.com | Internal Meta correspondence; subject to company retention policies. |
| **Former Work** | tedn@microsoft.com | Historical address used from 2019–2024 while at Microsoft. No longer active. |

## Security & Privacy Practices
- **Compartmentalization:** Distinct inboxes reduce metadata linking across professional and personal contexts.  
- **Alias Domain (`tedditory.co`):** Custom domain regulated by Ted, allowing creation of project‑specific aliases (e.g., hire@tedditory.co).  
- **Forwarding & Filtering:** Rules route newsletters and low‑priority mail to dedicated labels, keeping the public inbox clean.  
- **2FA:** All accounts secured with app‑based two‑factor authentication. Recovery codes stored offline.

## Best‑Contact Guidance
1. **General inquiries, collaborations, media:** use `contact@tedditory.co`.  
2. **Hiring managers or recruiters:** may request a unique alias (e.g., `recruiter-<company>@tedditory.co`) to track outreach.  
3. **Existing Meta colleagues:** continue using `tedn@meta.com` for internal matters.
