# Expertise · Real Estate Investing

### Origin Story
- Childhood fascination with architecture—young Ted was the kid who stopped to admire curb appeal and floor‑plan brochures.  
- Moving to the U.S. revealed that owning a home was within reach, especially during the post‑COVID era of record‑low interest rates.  

### Learning Journey
- Self‑taught through BiggerPockets podcasts, *House Hack* case studies, and underwriting spreadsheets.  
- Completed courses on REIT analysis, private lending, and short‑term‑rental management.

### Investment Experiments

- **REITs** — sector benchmarking.  
- **Private Lending** — participated in peer‑to‑peer senior‑debt notes (8–12 % APR).  
- **Second‑Lien & Bridge Loans** — short‑duration, higher‑yield debt with collateralized risk.  
- **Hands‑On Rentals** — prefers controllable, value‑add projects such as furnishing units and branding (“Sunny Nest,” “The Nook”).  

### Operating Philosophy & Strengths
- **Value‑Add Mindset** — looks for under‑managed properties where better design and hospitality command premium rents.  
- **Data‑Driven Underwriting** — uses Zillow comps, and custom Excel models to price offers and exit strategies.  
- **Hospitality Focus** — treats tenants as guests; aims for >4.8 ★ average reviews and <8 % annual vacancy.  

### Impact Highlights

| First townhouse | Achieved break‑even within 4 months; now cash‑flows \$x00/mo. |
| Second property | Acquired at bottom market at a \$x0,000-discounsted price. |
